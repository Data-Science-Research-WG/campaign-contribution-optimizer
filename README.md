### Running script to get output on PowerBI
1. Ensure the python home with the version you want to use is detected by PowerBI. This can be checked by going to Options and Settings > Python Scripting.
2. You will need Pandas and Numpy and all their dependencies in the Lib folder of your python version root directory. You can simply copy and paste the folder containing these folders to Lib if you have them installed elsewhere. 
3. In PowerBI desktop navigate to Get Data > Python Script.
4. Copy and paste the code from the CCO_dyna_prog.py script.
5. Copy and paste the code from the cco_script.py minus the import commands below the lines of code from CCO_dyna_prog.py.
6. Connect to PowerBI and a number of tables from the DataFrames generated by the code should display.
7. Take the 'output' table.
